# `lol`

Toy programming language based on [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
and [Writing an/a interpreter/compiler in Go](https://compilerbook.com/). 
I will try to write everything using the standard lib in Go, including codegen
to [QBE](https://c9x.me/compile/) and/or [WASM](https://webassembly.org/).
